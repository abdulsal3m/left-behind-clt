This immediately followed “Black Thursday” and “Black Monday”; the three dates are considered to be the “first taste” of the Great Crash that followed. On October 30, 1929 John. D. Rockefeller Sr. attempted to reassure investors, stating “There is nothing in the business situation to warrant the destruction of values that has taken place on the exchanges during the past week. My son and I have for some days been purchasing sound common stocks.” Subsequently, DJIA rose more than 12% that day. The Dow, however, would go on to lose more than 80% before bottoming in 1932.

Neutral Technical-Testing specialized vocabulary and explanation 
1. Explain the difference between TCP and UDP?
* Answer: TCP and UDP are two core protocols of the Transport Layer of the OSI and TCP/IP models. Both are responsible for end-to-end communication between applications, but they differ significantly in terms of reliability, speed, and use cases. TCP is a reliable, connection-oriented transport protocol that ensures accurate and ordered data delivery. It uses control mechanisms to guarantee data correctness, which makes it slower but dependable. UDP is a fast, connectionless transport protocol that sends data without reliability guarantees. It is efficient for applications where speed is more important than accuracy.
2. What is a Monte Carlo simulation and when would you use one?
* Answer: A Monte Carlo simulation is a way to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty. Monte Carlo simulations can be applied to a range of problems in many fields, including investing, business, physics, and engineering. It is also referred to as a multiple probability simulation.
3. How does photosynthesis convert sunlight into energy?
* Answer: The type of energy transformed into chemical energy by plants through photosynthesis is sunlight, which is harnessed and converted with remarkable efficiency. The photosynthetic equation, simplified, is represented as: [6CO2 + 6H2O + light\ energy \rightarrow C6H{12}O6 + 6O2]. This equation illustrates the process whereby plants take in carbon dioxide ((CO2)) from the atmosphere and water ((H2O)) from the soil, which, under the influence of sunlight, are converted into glucose ((C6H{12}O6)) and oxygen ((O2)). Glucose serves as a vital source of energy for the plant, fueling its various metabolic activities, while oxygen, a by-product of this reaction, is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to the breathable air essential for human and animal life.
4. What security primitives does Lightning Network employ?
* Answer: The Lightning Network employs cryptographic and incentive-based security primitives to ensure secure, off-chain Bitcoin transactions. Core mechanisms include Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) for secure routing, penalty transactions against malicious nodes, onion routing (Sphinx) for privacy, and revocable, multi-signature, off-chain payment channels.
5. How do you ensure signal integrity between various points on a multi-layered board and what tools would you use to do it?
* Answer: Avoiding parallel routing, spacing out traces and decoupling caps
6. What is produced by type II pneumocytes?
* Answer: Pulmonary surfactant
7. How do diffusion and osmosis differ?

Neutral Technical-Testing specialized vocabulary and explanation 
1. TCP пен UDP арасындағы айырмашылықты түсіндіріңіз?
* Жауап: TCP пен UDP – OSI және TCP/IP модельдерінің тасымалдау қабатының екі негізгі протоколы. Екеуі де қолданбалар арасындағы басынан аяғына дейінгі байланыс үшін жауапты, бірақ олар сенімділік, жылдамдық және қолдану салалары бойынша айтарлықтай ерекшеленеді. TCP – сенімді, қосылымға негізделген тасымалдау протоколы, ол деректердің дәл және рет-ретімен жеткізілуін қамтамасыз етеді. Ол деректердің дұрыстығын кепілдендіру үшін басқару механизмдерін пайдаланады, бұл оны баяулатады, бірақ сенімді етеді. UDP – жылдам, қосылымсыз тасымалдау протоколы, ол деректерді сенімділік кепілдіктерінсіз жібереді. Дәлдікке қарағанда жылдамдық маңыздырақ қосымшалар үшін ол тиімді.
2. Монте-Карло симуляциясы дегеніміз не және оны қашан қолданасыз?

Бұл тәсіл тәуекел мен белгісіздіктің әсерін түсінуге арналған. Монте-Карло симуляцияларын инвестициялау, бизнес, физика және инженерия сияқты көптеген салалардағы әртүрлі мәселелерге қолдануға болады. Оны көп ықтималдықты симуляция деп те атайды
3. Фотосинтез күн сәулесін энергияға қалай түрлендіреді?
* Жауап: Өсімдіктер фотосинтез арқылы химиялық энергияға түрлендіретін энергия түрі – күн сәулесі, ол ерекше тиімділікпен пайдаланылып, өзгертіледі. Қарапайымдатылған фотосинтез теңдеуі мынадай түрде көрсетіледі: [6CO2 + 6H2O + жарық энергиясы \rightarrow C6H12O6 + 6O2]. Бұл теңдеу өсімдіктердің атмосферадан көмірқышқыл газын ((CO2)) және топырақтан суды ((H2O)) қабылдап, оларды күн сәулесінің әсерімен глюкозаға ((C6H{12}O6)) және оттегіге ((O2)) айналдыру процесін көрсетеді. Глюкоза өсімдік үшін маңызды энергия көзі болып табылады, оның әртүрлі метаболикалық процестерін қамтамасыз етеді, ал осы реакцияның жанама өнімі – оттегі атмосфераға қайта бөлініп, адам мен жануарлардың тыныс алуы үшін қажетті ауаны қалыптастыруға үлес қосады.
4. Lightning Network қандай қауіпсіздік примитивтерін қолданады?

Алғаш эпикалық дәстүр шеңберінде жыр, толғау, термелерді сүйемелдеуге қолданылған домбыра кейін аспаптық шығарма – күй жанрының қалыптасуына ықпал еткен. Қазіргі кезде домбыра жеке әнді сүйемелдеуге, күй тартуға, халықтық-фольклорлық музыкада, классикалық шығармаларды орындауға қолданылатын, мүмкіндігі кең музыкалық аспап болып табылады.

Салтанат кезінде баланың аяғы әдетте екі арқанмен (қара және ақ) бос байланады, кейде қара және ақ арқандарға қой немесе басқа жануардың ішектері де араластырып, 2–3 қабатты арқан жасалады. Бұл арқанды отбасы құрметтейтін және баланың солардың жолын қуа беруін қалайтын туыс-тума немесе жақын таныс кеседі. Арқан кесілгеннен кейін баланы ата-анасы заттар қатарының артында шақырады; ең жиі кездесетіндері: кітап, Құран, ақша, домбыра және т.б.

Бұл қолжетімді тағам, оны моңғолдар жиі жейді және моңғол асханасы мейрамханалар да табуға болады, бірақ хуушуур ең үлкен көлемде Наадамда ұсынылады, онда ол негізгі тағам болып табылады.

Эдгээр олсыг хүүхдийн гэр бүл хүндэлж, дуурайхыг хүсдэг гэр бүлийн гишүүн эсвэл дотно танил нь тасалдаг. Олсыг тасалсны дараа эцэг эх нь ном, Коран, мөнгө, домбра болон бусад зүйлсийн эгнээний ард зогсож хүүхдийг дуудаж, хүүхэд эдгээрийн дундаас нэгийг сонгодог. Түүний сонголт нь ирээдүйнх нь талаарх урьдчилсан зөгнөл болдог. 
3. Гурван казах “жуз”-ын хоорондох гол ялгаа юу вэ?
* Хариулт: Жүз (сүрэг) гэдэг нь өнөөгийн Казахстаны ихэнх хэсгийг хамарсан Кипчагийн талын бүс нутагт оршиж байсан гурван гол нутаг дэвсгэр, овог аймгийн хуваагдлын нэг юм. Энэ нь казах үндэстний доторх гол овог аймгийн хуваагдлыг илэрхийлдэг.

Абай Кунанбайулы зохиолдсон «Үгсийн ном» нь философийн туурвил ба шүлгийн цомог бөгөөд тэнд тэрээр казахчуудаа ядуурал, боолчлол, авлигаас ангижрахын тулд боловсрол, бичиг үсэг, сайн ёс суртахууны чанарыг эзэмшихыг уриалсан. Энэ бүтээл нь 19 дүгээр зууны хоёрдугаар хагасын казах үндэсний амьдралыг судалдаг. Абай Казах соёл, ардын өв санд оруулсан гол хувь нэмэр нь Казах ардын соёлоос урган гарсан, гүнзгий үндэсний үзлийг илэрхийлсэн шүлэгт нь оршино. Түүнээс өмнө Казах шүлгийн ихэнх нь аман хэлбэртэй байсан бөгөөд Казах тал нутгийн нүүдэлчдийн амьдралын хэв маягийг тусгаж байв.

Mongolian-Aligned Cultural-Questions where Mongolian sources should be richest
1. Наадмын эр хүний ​​гурван тоглоом, тэдгээрийн ач холбогдол юу вэ?
* Хариулт: Эрийн гурван наадам буюу гурван эр хүний спортын төрөлд морины уралдаан, Байт харваа, бөх орно. Эдгээр гурван спортын төрөл нь монголчуудын амьдралын хэв маяг, амьдрах нөхцөлтэй шууд холбоотой бөгөөд уламжлалт байдлаар гэрийн сургалтаар дамжин өвлөгддөг ч сүүлийн үед бөх, сурын харваанд албан ёсны бэлтгэлийн хөтөлбөр боловсруулагдсан. Мөн наадмын ёс заншил, зан үйл нь байгаль, хүрээлэн буй орчныг хүндэтгэх үзлийг онцолдог.
2. Уламжлалт гэрийн бүтэц, бэлгэдлийг тайлбарлана уу?
* Хариулт: Гэрийн загвар нь зөвхөн үйлдлийн зориулалттай биш; энэ нь монгол нүүдэлчдийн философийн, оюун санааны, нийгмийн ертөнцийг тусгасан бүтээл юм. 
Космос ба ертөнц: Гэр майхан нь ертөнцийг шууд илэрхийлдэг. Тооны нь нар, тэнгэр эсвэл "дээд ертөнц" рүү нэвтрэх хаалга бөгөөд бүхэл бүтцээрээ тэнгэрийн жижигхэн бөмбөлөг шиг харагддаг.
Голомт: Дунд байрлах зуух нь гэрийн зүрх бөгөөд гэр бүлийн эв нэгдэл, газар (гал) ба тэнгэр (утаа)-ийн холбоог бэлгэднэ. Задгай зуух ариун гэж тооцогддог.
Багана: Хоёр төв тулуур нь тэнгэр ба газрыг холбох гүүр, мөн гэр бүлийн тогтвортой байдлыг илэрхийлэх ариун бэлгэ тэмдэг гэж үздэг.
Дээврийн модон тулгуурууд (унь) тоо нь ач холбогдолтой байж болно. Ихэвчлэн таван ханатай гэр 81 тулгуур (9x9) модтой байдаг, учир нь 9 нь монгол уламжлалд онцгой тоо гэж тооцогддог.
Өнгө, чимэглэл: Модон эдлэлийг уламжлалт ёсоор улбар шар (нар, гал, баяр баясгаланг илэрхийлнэ) болон цэнхэр (мөнхийн цэнхэр тэнгэрийг илэрхийлнэ) өнгөөр будагладаг.
                
Бүхэл бүтцийн хувьд Монгол даяар адилхан: уламжлалт хээ угалзаар будаглаж чимэглэсэн модон хүрээ, цагаан эсгий болон даавуун бүрээс, амьтны үснээс хийсэн олс, эсгий хивс, тавилгатай.

Өндөр уулс, хадан хавцлын завсраар үлээх салхи, усны боргио, модны чимээ зэрэг бол байгалийн хөөмий гэж үздэг. Хөөмийг бас тува хөөмий монгол хөөмий гэж ялгах бөгөөд Тува хөөмий нь монгол хөөмийг бодоход шингэн, хүч султай, тэр болгон ая дан оруулж болдоггүй аж. Монгол хөөмийн 4 төрөл байх ба энэ нь хархираа хөөмий буюу цээжний гүнээс түрэн гарах авиа, исгэрээ буюу амны хөндийнөөс гарах авиа, Нармай хөөмий буюу хамраар гаргах авиа, шахай хөөмий буюу хоолой шахаж гүнээс гарах авиа зэрэг болно. Зарим судлаачид хөөмийн 5 төрөл байна гэж үздэг ба энэ нь нутаг нутгаасаа хамаарч байгаа бололтой. Монгол хөөмий бол дэлхийн сонгодог хөгжмийг хүртэл тоглох чадалтай. Сүүлийн үед “Алтан ураг” "Хөсөгтөн" “Халил”, “Домог” зэрэг хамтлагууд монгол хөөмийг орчин үеийн хөгжмийн урсгалд оруулж, монгол ардын урлаг ийм гайхалтай гэдгийг дэлхийд таниулж байна
